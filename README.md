# Counter-WebApp
This is a simple web app in which there is a counter which start from zero. There are two button minus(-) and plus(+). On clicking plus or minus counter updates by 1 value. This web app is made up using HTML, Tailwind CSS and JavaScript. The purpose of building this web app is to learn the working of tailwind CSS and JavaScript.
Here I used Tailwind CSS.
